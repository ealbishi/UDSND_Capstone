To do that these promotion should be cnsider the type of item I regulary paid and type of promotin. Because of the data sets were provided not have a product type, we going to to develop a recommendation engine which help Starbucks to sent an approbite offer to their customers. We have to explore some points:

- Starbucks customers
- Most accepted offer for every customer group
- Distribution of offers type vs. group of customers
